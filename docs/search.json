By examinig a dataset of various car models, we discover a notable correlation between the two. Larger engine sizes tend to result in lower highway miles per gallon, and smaller engine sizes tend to result in higher highway miles per gallon.\n\n\nQUESTION|TASK 1\nTODO:COPY PASTE QUESTION|TASK 1 FROM THE PROJECT HERE\n1.Finish the readings, setup, and be prepared with any questions to get your environment working smoothly (class for on-campus and Slack for online)\nI have finished the readings and setup.\n\n\nQUESTION|TASK 2\nTODO: COPY PASTE QUESTION|TASK 2 FROM THE PROJECT HERE\n2.In VS Code, create the example chart from section 3.2.2 of the textbook. (Note: you will be using Plotly Express to display the chart instead of Altair which is used in the book)\nTODO: type your results and analysis here\nFrom the following chart we can see the relation between the “hwy” and “displ.” “hwy” stands for highway miles per gallon (mpg), which is a measure of fuel efficiency for vehicles when driven on highways. “displ” stands for engine displacement, which is the total volume of all the cylinders in a nengine. Engine displacement is an important factor in determining the power and performance characteristics of an engine. From the analysis of the data chart, we see the trend the larger the engine- smaller the fuel efficiency, and smaller the engine- better the fuel efficiency.\n\n\nRead and format data\n# Include and execute your code here\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\nmpg = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byuidatascience/data4python4ds/master/data-raw/mpg/mpg.csv\")\n\nchart = px.scatter(mpg, x='displ', y='hwy')  \n\nchart.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nQUESTION|TASK 3\nTODO: COPY PASTE QUESTION|TASK 3 FROM THE PROJECT HERE\n3.Your final report should also include the table created from the following (assuming you have mpg from question 2)\nTODO: type your results and analysis here\nFrom the following table we see the summary of four of the properties of the dataset we are working with.
